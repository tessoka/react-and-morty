import React from 'react'

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className="description">
      <p>Do you know Rick and Morty? If not, start watching it!</p>
      <p>Anyways, the Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with lot of characters and locations. 
        Me and my friends decided that we want to make it easier to look up information about each characters and locations.
        We created a React app that with the use of an open-source API, shows information about everything you need to know.</p>
    </div> 
  )
}

export default Home
