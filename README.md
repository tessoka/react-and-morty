# React and Morty

## Description

Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with lot of characters and locations. This website makes it easier to look up information about each characters and locations with the use of an open-source API.
This was a group project where the individuals contributed to the final output during a week of work with multiple commits.

## Implementation

- When someone enters the web site, they will see a Rick and Morty logo with 2 buttons. The buttons will be the trigger to show the characters or the locations but as default a short description about the page is shown.
- The lists contain cards, one card shows details about the given character/location.
- At the end of the Character list there is a pagination bar where we can switch between pages.
- The Locations page fatches the additional data by scroll down, with the help of infinite scroll plugin.
- Card components shows more specific information about the characters by flipping the card when we click on it.
